Adding SSH key to github


  Open your terminal or command prompt.

  Enter the following command, replacing your_email@example.com with your GitHub email address:

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

  When prompted to specify a file to save the key, press Enter to use the default location (~/.ssh/id_ed25519).

  If prompted, enter and confirm a passphrase (or leave it blank for no passphrase).

 Ensure the SSH agent is running:

   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

 Add your SSH private key to the agent:

    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519


Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard. Use the following command:

    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy 

Windows:

    clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Add the SSH Key to GitHub

    Add a title for your key (e.g., "My Laptop SSH Key").
    Paste the key you copied in Step 3 into the "Key" field.
    Click Add SSH key and, if prompted, confirm your GitHub password.
